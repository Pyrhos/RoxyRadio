# Rourin Radio

Rourin Radio is a web player that turns karaoke VODs into a timestamped “radio” of songs.

## Features

- **Song-only vs. full-stream playback**
    - **Standard mode (Yap Off)** – plays only marked song segments and skips everything in between.
    - **Yap Mode (On)** – plays the full stream continuously with gaps and talk present.

- **Loop & shuffle**
    - **Loop Track** – repeat the current song indefinitely.
    - **Loop Stream** – loop all songs in the current stream.
    - **Shuffle** – randomizes the next stream; previous-stream button uses a session history so you can backtrack shuffled picks.

- **Session history & persistence**
    - Remembers your **Yap**, **Loop**, **Shuffle** settings and the last played stream + timecode across sessions.
    - Keeps a short **session-only history**, so you can jump back through previously played streams while the tab is open.

- **Search & duplicates**
    - Fuzzy search across all available songs.
    - Multiples detection
